## Vocabulary
* tp - teleport
* rss - resources

## General tips

* Enable game push down notifications. Go to game setting notifications. Disable all trash.
* You should enable notification for at least aliance anouncement and privat messages.
* Don't waste your warp on shit. I believe at some point you will need it to buy that 2nd queue buffs and some shrine upgrades you can't gather mats for.
* Always do all your trials (even if you don't need rss atm).
* Take part in challenges (its the goat head). Sometimes they are trivial, but will yield 150-300 warp. This is free money!

## Combat
We don't really know how game mechanics work for this game. How do these attack and defence numbers come together.
But we know for sure some things.
* high tier units own, get them asap
* there no point in producing low tier units (unless you need quest completion)
* to defeate an army without losses you need more than 10x power
* save your better units for aliance fights. if they die on army marches you are doing it wrong.
* You can always use your shield or teleport, even when someone marches on you. Don't take one for the team if you can't handle it! (if you are not sure, you can't handle it!)

## Aliance tactics
* Always have at least one shield
* Always have at least 2 teleports
* Use the rest of your coins to get 3hr speed ups. Use those upgrade on your Keep preferably (it is the bottle neck upgrade process usually).

## Champion
Champions are very important in terms of game buffs.
### Champion tree
* construction and ritual buffs are the most important by far
* construction give your champ XP, so max construction = faster XP
* rituals give better buffs overal
### Vanquish tree
Max Champ recovery II ASAP. There are several strats to go from here
* Max stamina via Boundles Stamina II
* Add appropriate number of attacks to spend your stamina in one march via Flurry of Attacks I

or

* Max Damage
Max number of attacks is preferred way because attacks give you loot. Making 3 attack with same damage give you better loot than 2.
Also quests in game require you to *attack* foes of level number of times (you don't actually need to finish em).
Finishing off enemy is always preferred so look for targets you can finish up on a march.

## Construction
Constuction is everything in this game... it gives you focus, makes you stronger.

You should be always upgrading your Keep!

If not upgrading your keep you should be upgrading Keep prerequisits only

<TODO cause can't see what keep depends atm>
* Wall
  * Quarry
* Citadel
  * Furnace
* Workshop
  * Bestiary
    * Mill
* Dungeon
  * Grounds
* Hole
  * Post
    * Warehouse
* Conclave
  * Sawbones

## Rituals
Some rituals are very important. You should always do rituals at low level just because they give some buffs for little time (effeciency).
### Military
### Champion
Champion combat - always get this to max. This is your primary souce of secret ingredients that allow you to up shrines and gear
### Defence
* Always up Defence capacity as soon as you don't have enough.
* Defence salvaging always up this because in case of attack you will be able to recover quickly
### Command
* Encampment ASAP
* March slot ASAP
* Aliance Help - max this as much as you can spare time
### Battle
### Daemonic
### Unholly
* March capacity is much desirable (you can pack more punch on your marches)

## Gathering
* Try to get an working camp or war camp on some distant high level territory as far away from othe pips!
High level territies are basically Empires.
* Level 6 nodes are the best to mine, they are the fastest to mine too.
* Try to use as many marches at once as you have. Every march give you gathering speed e.g. 2 marches gather rss 2x faster!
Use one big march if you can't idle in game.
