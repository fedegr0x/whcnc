## Vocabulary
* tp - teleport
* rss - resources
* ASAP - as soon as possible
* T$ - tier $ units

## General tips

* Enable game push down notifications. Go to game setting notifications. Disable all trash.
* You should enable notification for at least aliance anouncement and privat messages.
* Don't waste your warp on shit. I believe at some point you will need it to buy that 2nd queue buffs and some shrine upgrades you can't gather mats for.
* Always do all your trials (even if you don't need rss atm).
* Take part in challenges (its the goat head). Sometimes they are trivial, but will yield 150-300 warp. This is free money!
* If there's no food all your troops will die and be taken to sawbones! So I suggest you upgrade your pens. And probably make more of it.

## Combat
We don't really know how game mechanics work for this game. How do these attack and defence numbers come together.
But we know for sure some things.
* High tier units own, get them ASAP
* There no point in producing low tier units (unless you need quest completion)
* To defeate an army without losses you need more than 10x power
* Save your better units for aliance fights. if they die on army marches you are doing it wrong.
* You can always use your shield or teleport, even when someone marches on you. Don't take one for the team if you can't handle it! (if you are not sure, you can't handle it!)
* When you have aproximately 10x more power you can overpower an army. Your trops die in small numbers.
* If you put some small number of T1 units in a march they appear to die first. Instead of your valuable Bloodletters.
* If your units defent fortress and get killed they are put in Sawbones and can be revived. So it's preferable for the enemy to attack into you. You get your troops back, they don't.
* Also if you reinforce a brother and your units get killed they will also return to your Sawbones! So reinforce a bro if you see em getting attacked!

## Aliance tactics
* Always have at least 1 shield
* Always have at least 2 teleports
* Use the rest of your coins to get 3hr speed ups. Use those upgrade on your Keep preferably (it is the bottle neck upgrade process usually).

## Champion
Champions are very important in terms of game buffs.
### Champion tree
* Construction and ritual buffs are the most important by far
* Construction give your champ XP, so max construction = faster XP
* Rituals give better buffs overal
### Vanquish tree
Max Champ recovery II ASAP. There are several strats to go from here
* Max stamina via Boundles Stamina II
* Add appropriate number of attacks to spend your stamina in one march via Flurry of Attacks I

or

* Max Damage

Max number of attacks is preferred way because attacks give you loot. Making 3 attack with same damage give you better loot than 2.
Also quests in game require you to *attack* foes of level number of times (you don't actually need to finish em).
Finishing off enemy is always preferred so look for targets you can finish up on a march.

## Construction
Constuction is everything in this game... it gives you focus, makes you stronger.

You should be always upgrading your Keep!

If not upgrading your keep you should be upgrading Keep prerequisits!

* Keep
  * Rift (at 15)
  * Wall
    * Quarry
* Citadel
  * Furnace
* Hellcanon
  * Workshop
    * Bestiary
      * Mill
* Dungeon
  * Grounds
    * Pens
* Hole
  * Post
    * Warehouse
* Conclave
  * Sawbones

## Rituals
Some rituals are very important. You should always do rituals at low level just because they give some buffs for little time (effeciency).
### Military
* T3 troops ASAP (this is top priority!)
### Champion
* Champion combat - always get this to max. This is your primary souce of secret ingredients that allow you to up shrines and gear
### Defence
* Always up Defence capacity as soon as you don't have enough.
* Defence salvaging always up this because in case of attack you will be able to recover quickly
### Command
* Encampment ASAP
* March slot ASAP
* Aliance Help - max this as much as you can spare time.
### Battle
### Daemonic
### Unholly
* March capacity is much desirable (you can pack more punch on your marches)

## Regs

* Chaos Rift needs Bound Screams
* War council needs Captured Plans
* Chaos Warshrine needs Infernal Grimoire
* HellCannon Emplacements need Defiled Bones
* Workshop needs Moot Leather
* Sorcerers Citadel needs Fell Magic Scrolls 
* Fortress Walls need Refined Steel
* Daemonic Forge needs Blood Of The Fallen
* You can buy a pile of regs for just 20 warp! You actually need just 1500 warp (not proven by actuall buy) to up all 3 gods (except Khorne) to progress to other daemons (and rituals tree).
* Pestilent flesh Nurgle - kill beast armies 4
* Offerings Khorne + Vessel Tzeentch + Amulet Slaanesh - kill empier armies 4, vanquish foe 5+

## Gathering
* Try to get an working camp or war camp on some distant high level territory as far away from othe pips!
High level territies are basically Empires.
* Level 6 nodes are the best to mine, they are the fastest to mine too.
* Try to use as many marches at once as you have. Every march give you gathering speed e.g. 2 marches gather rss 2x faster!
Use one big march if you can't idle in game.
* Rss buildings give so little income compared to gathering that there's very little point in upgrading. Except for pits. They are needed to offset your troops upkeep, so I suggest you make more of them than other structures.
